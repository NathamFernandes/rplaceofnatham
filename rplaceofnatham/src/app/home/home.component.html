                    <p>Hello there! Here is my website, it's like a CV but I will put anything that cross my mind here.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>So, who am I, for God's sake?</h2>
                <p>As Heraclitus once said: "No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and
                    he's
                    not
                    the same man". So, i'm constantly changing. Anyways, I'm a person that really enjoy informatics and
                    computer
                    science in general - since computer eletronics, computer architecture (how these two things are
                    connected?
                    so awesome!), softwares and this kind of things, in a pyramidal
                    way of abstraction level. All my life I was really into games and computers - I remember that I used
                    to
                    play
                    Super Bomberman 3 (or it was 5, can't remember) when I was 4 years old, and I used to get very mad
                    when
                    my
                    parents stopped me from playing after 10pm.
                </p>

                <p>Anyway, going back, I'm currently studying Information
                    Technology
                    at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, which is a bachelor degree. I also have a technical
                    course
                    Rio Grande do Norte, which was my first official approach to the academic world. As you might see, I
                    can
                    talk in english pretty well, but my native language it's Portuguese (of course, i'm from Brazil,
                    duh!).
                    I've
                    tried to
                    learn German, but at this moment I only know how to say hello and how many years old I am: "Hallo!
                    Ich
                    bin
                    neunzehn Jarhe alt." (pretty impresive, huh?) </p>

                <p>Anyway (remember to change this word, i've used a lot of times here), I'm a normal guy that just want
                    to
                    be
                    myself, hang out with some friends sometimes, get to know new things and experiences, and enjoy
                    life. If
                    you
                    read it
                    untill here, congrats. You won a candy! Or a cookie, depends on this method of computers storing

                <h2>Games</h2>
                <p>As I said, I play games since I was young. Nowdays, I'm pretty confident to say that Counter-Strike:
                    Global
                    Offensive (CS:GO) is my beloved one. Don't get me wrong, League of Legends and these other games are
                    pretty
                    fun too. It's just because CS is in my veins. My higher rank was "Aguia 2" (which is Eagle II rank
                    or the third to last rank on CS) playing with my friends, who were pretty competitive too.
                    Unfornately,
                    I don't have a picture of that moment, but I do have when I was Eagle I:</p>

                <h3>Fun fact: I've played against Vini from Furia once!</h3>
                <p>That's right. In a normal and beautiful day of my pandemic life, I started a matchmaking with my
                    friends,
                    around 3:00 am. And guess what? We faced Vini (at that time he was playing for Furia) and LÃ©o Ramos,
                    from
                    the Supercombo band (brazilian famous band). It was shocking and amazing. Unfornately, they couldn't
                    sign our
                    profiles, but we've taken screenshots from the moment. :D </p>
